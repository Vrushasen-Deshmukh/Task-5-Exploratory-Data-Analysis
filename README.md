# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# Titanic Passenger Data

•	Task 5:  
•	Objective: Extract insights using visual and statistical exploration. 
 
ABOUT THE DATA: 
Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, with details that can help us analyse patterns—especially regarding survival. 
 
APPROACH TO EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS: 
1.	Download the dataset from Kaggle. 
2.	Import the data into Jupyter Notebook. 
3.	Create a new file named Task5 into the Notebook. 
4.	Import pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, openpyxl into the library. 
5.	Perform Basic data cleaning on the dataset. 
6.	Perform Basic data exploration. 
•	What kind of data do we have? 
•	How many rows/columns are there? 
•	Are there any missing values? 
•	What are the numerical distributions? 
7.	Plot charts using imported libraries. 
8.	Understand Insights of the visualization output. 
9.	Create a Report of the EDA. 

The Titanic dataset reveals strong patterns in passenger survival based on gender, class, age, and fare. Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males, highlighting the "women and children first" evacuation protocol. Passengers in 1st class, who paid the highest fares, were more likely to survive, while 3rd class passengers with the lowest fares faced the lowest survival rates, showing a clear link between socio-economic status and survival. Most passengers were young adults, but children—especially in higher classes—had better survival chances. Scatter plots showed that younger, higher-paying passengers had better odds of survival, although no strong linear correlation between fare and age was found. Box plots confirmed the stark difference in fare across passenger classes, with 1st class showing the widest fare range and highest median. Overall, survival was influenced by a combination of gender, class, fare, and age, highlighting inequality in life-and death outcomes aboard the Titanic.
